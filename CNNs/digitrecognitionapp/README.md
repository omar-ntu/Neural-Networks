# Digit Recognition Web Application
This webapp is built using Flask, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

It's built to visualise the model predicting the user's inputs (i.e. handwritten digits).

Currently it's not working like it should be. I'm in the middle of fixing that.

(8 November 2023) Fixed CNN not giving accurate results. Just left with fixing the layout of the webpage to make it look nice, but either way it's already functional.

(9 November 2023) Fixed.

(17 November 2023) Deployed publicly on Render. Link: https://digit-recognition-0789.onrender.com/
