# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
This repository contains implementations of GANs to generate fake images based on given data.

For example, performing on the MNIST dataset to generate fake images of handwritten digits.

The GAN I used for the MNIST project doesn't seem to be very good. If I add 1 more epoch, it becomes overfitted, and I only trained the model for 3 epochs. I guess I'll need to delete some stuff from the neural network and re-train it so I can produce better images.
